# Install Xcode Command Line Tools (includes Git)
xcode-select --install

cd /Users/ricardoesteban/Invoicepatch_flutter
git add lib/core/routing/app_router.gr.dart
git add flutter_installation_guide.md
git add push_changes.md
git commit -m "Fix router error: Add missing $AppMainRouter class"
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Manual Upload via GitHub Web Interface
1. Go to https://github.com/Redsteban/Invoicepatch_flutter
2. Navigate to `lib/core/routing/`
3. Click "Add file" > "Upload files"
4. Upload the `app_router.gr.dart` file from your local machine
5. Add commit message: "Fix router error: Add missing $AppMainRouter class"
6. Click "Commit changes"

## Summary of Fix
The error "Type '_$AppMainRouter' not found" was caused by a missing generated file. I created the `app_router.gr.dart` file with the proper `$AppMainRouter` abstract class that extends `RootStackRouter` and includes all the necessary route mappings.

This should resolve the Xcode build error you were experiencing.
